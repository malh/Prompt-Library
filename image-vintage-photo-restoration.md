# Prompt: Vintage Photo Restoration

## Description
This prompt transforms an old, possibly black-and-white or low-resolution vintage photo into a modern, high-resolution portrait. The goal is to maintain historical authenticity — the people, their clothing, and setting — while reimagining the photo as if it were taken today with professional equipment and natural realism.

## Use Case
Useful for:
- AI image generation (e.g. Midjourney, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion)
- Digital restorations
- Family history projects
- Cultural preservation with modern aesthetics

## Prompt

> Reimagine this vintage photo as a modern, high-resolution portrait taken with a professional DSLR. Preserve the original people, their expressions, clothing, and setting, but enhance everything with natural realism. Accurately colourise skin tones, fabric, and background using soft indoor lighting. Add gentle depth of field to keep the subjects in crisp focus while softly blurring the background. Retain the original atmosphere and cultural context, but modernise the image with clean resolution, rich texture, and true-to-life details.
